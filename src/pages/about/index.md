### Engineer by thought

### designer by practice

### And a dangerous environmentalist that will chase you to end of the earth just for littering.

Hi I’m Azeem. I’m a web UI designer/developer/engineer with five years of experience working in e-commerce, online learning, health, non-profits, health and government. 

I love mixing technology with art. User Interface and visual design are my core strengths. I’m also proficient at UX design and rapidly levelling up. I aspire to become a full stack product designer where I take your story or idea and bring it to life! 

I’m extremely passionate about designing for promising startups and products that help entrepreneurs, agencies and businesses raise their game.

And did I forget to add? I love Coldplay and FC Barcelona
