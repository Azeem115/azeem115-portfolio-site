Hi I’m Azeem and I'm from Karachi, Pakistan. I am a product designer with over seven years of experience in the field, with a strong background in web, UI, and UX design, as well as front-end development. My passion for creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences has driven me to continuously improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies.

I am an accomplished designer with a proven track record of delivering successful projects for a wide range of clients including e-commerce, online learning, health, non-profits, health and government. I have a strong eye for detail and a dedication to creating designs that not only look great, but also solve complex problems and meet the needs of users.

In addition to my design skills, I also have extensive experience as a front-end developer, which enables me to collaborate with developers and product managers to translate concepts into live prototypes and accessible and responsive Web user interfaces. I partner with product teams to define, validate, and prioritize core use cases and document key user journeys, workflows, and product opportunities.

If you are looking for a talented and experienced product designer who can bring fresh ideas and a results-driven approach to your team, please don't hesitate to reach out. I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your product's success.
