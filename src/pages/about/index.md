### And a dangerous environmentalist that will chase you to end of the earth just for littering.

Hi I’m Azeem. and I'm from Karachi, Pakistan. I’m a **web UI designer/developer/engineer** with five years of experience having worked for various clients for e-commerce, online learning, health, non-profits, health and government.

I collaborate with developers and project managers to translate concepts into live prototypes and accessible and responsive Web user interfaces.

I love mixing technology with art. User Interface and visual design are my core strengths. I’m also proficient at UX design and rapidly levelling up. I aspire to become a full stack product designer where I take your story or idea and bring it to life!
