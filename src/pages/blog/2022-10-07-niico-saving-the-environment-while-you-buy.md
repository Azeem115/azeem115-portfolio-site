**Niico** is an environmental-conscience B2C startup with a simplified USP: plant trees when you buy our products.

Cloud Primero partnered with Niico to deliver a mobile application product aimed at managing carbon footprint by planting trees in exchange for bamboo tissue papers. The app features a subscription based pricing model and a marketplace for the tissue papers.

The design team conducted the design process for the product by mapping out the user journey, followed by wireframes of different app screens and finally implementing the UI design of the app using illustrations, animations and different interactions.

In the visual design phase, we explored different shades of green keeping in the view the theme of the environment and ecology. 

The MVP was segmented into four components: subscriptions, marketplace, community and referrals.

We implemented a persuasive gamification in order to retain customer engagement and avoid churns.

The dashboard displays all KPIs including the subscriptions, managing deliveries and how many trees they have planted. Each component uses an illustration to provide the user with up to the minute updates.

In the marketplace, users can shop for various tissue paper rolls. They have the option to choose a Subscription plan or Buy One Time plan. Each plan informs the user the amount of trees planted and carbon offset value. 

The Community section is where users can see how much impact they have made, how much oxygen have they released into the air and how many trees have they planted altogether.

In the subscription section, users can set the frequency on the delivery of products 

All these components were brought together and converted into a clickable prototype.

After completing the prototype, we conducted a usability testing session with five users using the Figma mirror app. This allowed us to validate the new design and refine them based on continuous feedback.
