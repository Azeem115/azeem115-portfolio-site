Since 2015, [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gdgkolachi/)GDG Kolachi has been organizing meetups and conferences for budding entrepreneurs, developers and tech enthusiasts in the city of Karachi. Its events have helped fresh graduates and tech professionals to network, seek guidance and counselling and help kickstart their careers in the tech ecosystem.

I attended Google DevFest 2021 which since its inception in 2017 has become the premier tech event in the city of 22 million people. It was there where I finally had the opportunity to interact with their core team comprising of software developers, designers and community managers. I expressed my interest to get involved in community work and use all my powers to.

That dream became a reality in early May 2022, when Hira Tariq, one of the community managers at GDG reached out to me to help organize their upcoming event BLAZE 2022.

Although it sounded exciting, I knew I had no experience of organizing events. As a non-profit community organization, GDG Kolachi does not charge any tickets for any of its events. The thought of pitching our ideas to sponsors, arranging the logistics and venue, getting the swag goods ready and entertaining hundreds of participants gave me butterflies in my stomach.

But I took a breath and said to myself either you accept this, learn along the way and grow out of your comfort zone or stay mediocre for the rest of your life.

I have always yearned to be part of such communities and events which never took place during my university days. I was hungry and determined to step out, provide whatever help I could to the upcoming generation who I never wanted to go through the pain and agony which I had to endure when I entered the job market and struggled building my career in tech. 

I answered yes to Hira's call. 

BLAZE 2022 is the first version of a series of events focusing on bringing together Pakistani women working in the tech industry. ‘BLAZE’ symbolizes the fire that exists within the Women of Pakistan who hold back due to the fear of trying new things in A male-dominated field.
