Since 2015,Â [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gdgkolachi/)GDG Kolachi has been organizing meetups and conferences for budding entrepreneurs, developers and tech enthusiasts in the city of Karachi. Its events have helped fresh graduates and tech professionals to network, seek guidance and counselling and help kickstart their careers in the tech ecosystem.

I attended Google DevFest 2021 where I finally had the opportunity to interact with their core team comprising of software developers, designers and community managers. I expressed my interest to get involved in community work.

That dream became a reality in early May 2022, when Hira Tariq, one of the community managers at GDG reached out to me to help organize their upcoming event BLAZE 2022.

Although it sounded exciting, I knew I had no experience of organizing events. The thought of pitching our ideas to sponsors, arranging the logistics and venue, getting the swag goods ready and entertaining hundreds of participants gave me butterflies in my stomach.

But I took a breath and said to myself either you accept this, learn along the way and grow out of your comfort zone.

I have always yearned to be part of such communities and events which never took place during my university days. I was hungry and determined to step out, provide whatever help I could to the upcoming generation who I never wanted to go through the pain and agony which I had to endure when entering the job market and building their careers. 

I answered yes to Hira's call. 

BLAZE 2022 is the first version of a series of events focusing on bringing together Pakistani women working in the tech industry. â€˜BLAZEâ€™ symbolizes the fire that exists within the Women of Pakistan who hold back due to the fear of trying new things in A male-dominated field.

I got down to work with other GDG volunteers Samima Khan, Danella Patrick, Hassam Jawed and Mursal Khan helping design the social media posts and the promotional material including the role cards, press wall, swag goods and other paraphernalia.

Although we had the design and brand guidelines provided, I realized making SM posts and other material based on those guidelines provided is a daunting task. Not only there is the demand to meet the guidelines but there are expectations to make the posts as aesthetically pleasing as ever. I remember staying up late at night after work getting those posts ready as we were racing against time.

Perhaps the most daunting task was reaching out to professionals as speakers. I had to be as professional as ever, drafting them the best emails and even calling them to ask them for their participation.

Nevertheless despite the jitters we made them ready and were able to secure the locations and sponsors for the event.

On Tuesday June 28, DHA Suffa University welcomed 400 participants to BLAZE 22. They all came with to connect, learn and celebrate. The event had an exciting line up of speakers including Sakina Abbas, Arbaz Pirwani, Ariba Shahid, Dr. Huma Jamshed, Imran Azhar, Numrah Khan, Wajahat Karim ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° and Mobeen Ahmed.

There were also workshops for both tech and non tech related areas, conducted by Ishaq Hassan and by Batool Aamir.

BLAZE also had a career fair where notable companies Savyour, HarKaam.com and Liquid Technologies set up their booths for aspiring fresh grads.

There was no time to celebrate as we had just few weeks to prepare for the next big event: Google I/O Extended Karachi 2022.

Besides delivering the SM posts and other marketing and promotional materials, I faced what was the most exhaustive task in recent memory. After we had closed registrations for Google I/O and shortlisted the applicants, the final spreadsheet of the confirmed participants was shared with us. Me, Samima, Hassam, Danella and Umar were tasked to send the confirmation messages to each participant individually either via SMS or WhatsApp. We all five agreed to split among the 817 confirmed participants and I messaged 157 people on WhatsApp and all those numbers populated my app. It was overwhelming for me as I was doing this late after midnight and needed rest.

There was also worry if we might be able to have the event given it was monsoon season and heavy rains lashed Karachi during the entire week. Miraculously, on the day of the event, it was relatively sunny and the event was pulled off successfully.

On July 30, as we were registering the participants at Iqra University, the chosen venue, we were hit with the bombshell news that the emcee has pulled out.

Somebody needs to step up. But the entire team is pinned so everyone is relying on you to take charge.

You have zero experience of hosting a show before let alone engaging 300+ people packed in one room.

You have only five minutes to decide.

What do you do? Do you wither away or step up and accept the challenge?

I choose to do the latter. And guess what, I nailed it!

And that is how I served as an emcee for more than 400 participants who came to Iqra University to attend Google I/O Extended 2022 on a rainy Saturday on July 30.

The event featured an exciting line-up of speakers. It was delightful to hear Eric ShangKuan, Eric Bhatti, Mashhood Rastgar, Khurram Kalimi, Wajahat Karim ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°, Farah Mehboob, Dr. Nadeem Qazi, Ishaq Hassan and Shamim Rajani sharing their knowledge and insights in Flutter, Android, AI/ML, tech entrepreneurship and culture.

The event also featured a community lounge and two codelabs where participants can seek guidance from professionals in AI/ML, Flutter, Android, UI/UX and Product Management.

As an emcee, for me standing on stage in front of 300 people was not an issue at all. The challenge was how to entertain them, engage them and keep them on their toes and not get them bored. When I took the stage, I asked everybody to stand up and do some morning stretches and breathing exercises. After that most of the time was spent introducing and inviting each speaker to give hisher talk on stage.

To sum it all up, it was an exhilarating experience. I could not believe we pulled it off two events in a space of one month despite the setbacks, challenges and the extreme weather. At BLAZE, we had to deal with the scorching heat while Google I/O Extended occured when the monsoon season had started and the city was wrecked with torrential rains a week prior to the event.

For me, it has to be the highlight of 2022. Organizing community-based events and even serving as an emcee to eradicate my fears of public speaking gave me a sense of spiritual fulfilment never felt before.

This is just the beginning of my journey as a community builder with GDG Kolachi and Women Techmakers Kolachi.
